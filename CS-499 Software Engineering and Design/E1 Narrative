The project I chose for enhancement one is a program that calculates interest. It was originally written in C++ in June of 2023.
It is from CS-210: Programing Languages. CS-210 teaches students how to write C++ code. To meet the software engineering and design 
enhancement requirements for this project, I converted the C++ code into Python and cleaned up the output format to look more visually 
appealing. 

Including this artifact in my ePortfolio is a good way to show my technical abilities. It shows I can work with C++ and Python. This
program is not a memory hog and would be beneficial for thew backend of a webapp. It is not meant to be a standalone application. For
this reason, I felt Python would be a better, more usable language, for the program to be written in. While working on the conversion,
in line comments were used so anyone looking at the code later can quickly understand what is going on. Doing so helps this enchantment
meet one of the course outcomes, which is to design, develop, and deliver professional-quality oral, written, and visual communications
that are coherent, technically sound, and appropriately adapted to specific audiences and contexts.  I created a technically sound
Python program. It shows my use of two different industry tools. PyCharm and Visual Studio were used in the conversion. Visual Studio
allowed me to test the original C++ code. PyCharm allowed me to efficiently code and debug the new Python code. The use of these tools
and my programing knowledge help meet another of the course goals, demonstrate an ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques,
skills, and tools in computing practices for the purpose of implementing computer solutions that deliver value and accomplish 
industry-specific goals.
