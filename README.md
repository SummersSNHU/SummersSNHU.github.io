# Introduction
  My name is Ryan Summers. This is an eProtfolio that was developed as a final project for my bachelorâ€™s degree at Southern New Hampshire University. It contains three separate projects I worked on throughout my course work. All three projects have been enhanced to meet the five specific course outcomes. These outcomes are: 
  1. Employ strategies for building collaborative environments that enable diverse audiences to support organizational decision making in the field of computer science
  2. Design, develop, and deliver professional-quality oral, written, and visual communications that are coherent, technically sound, and appropriately adapted to specific audiences and contexts
  3. Design and evaluate computing solutions that solve a given problem using algorithmic principles and computer science practices and standards appropriate to its solution, while managing the trade-offs involved in design choices
  4. Demonstrate an ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques, skills, and tools in computing practices for the purpose of implementing computer solutions that deliver value and accomplish industry-specific goals
  5. Develop a security mindset that anticipates adversarial exploits in software architecture and designs to expose potential vulnerabilities, mitigate design flaws, ensure privacy and enhanced security of data and resources

  Accompanying each of the three projects are brief descriptions of the project, original code I developed in courses, enhanced code I wrote in CS-499, and a narrative explaining how I met the course outcomes.


     
## Code Review
  Code reviews are an important part of software development. Often code is written hastily. It can function but may not be up to industry standards. They allow developers time to scrutinize all aspects of the code base. Code reviews help ensure quality products are produced. Linked below is my code review of the three projects I have listed on this site.
